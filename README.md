# Friggeri CV (MS Word)

Originally created by Adrien Friggeri, this CV template is popular with users of the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) application. Unfortunately the [ Friggeri template hosted by LaTeX](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv) is known to be broken and there does not seem to be any community effort to replicate it. Due to how complex LaTeX is for the average user, I've ported the template to MS Word.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you up and running in no time.

### Prerequisites

Before you open the Word document, I recommend you first install the Roboto font which is used for the header. If you do not wish to install the font, it should default to Times New Roman.

### Installing

1. Double click on the individual fonts inside the /fonts directory and accept the installation
2. Open the cv_public.docx
